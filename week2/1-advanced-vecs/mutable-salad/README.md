# 2.1 - Mutable Salad

## Instructions

- Step 1: Open your Rust programming environment and ensure that you have your Rust IDE or text editor open and ready
  for development.

- Step 2: Create a new Rust project.

- Step 3: Navigate to the src/main.rs file. This file should contain the skeleton code for your project.

- Step 4: Implement Vector operations. Create a Vector called fruit_salad that contains a list of fruits like "apple", "
  banana", "cherry", etc.

- Step 5: Tasks
    - Add a new fruit to the Vector using the push method.
    - Remove the last fruit from the Vector using the pop method.
    - Iterate through the Vector and print each fruit.
    - Save your project.

- Step 6: Compile and run the project.

- Step 7: Verify the output.

## Challenges

- Can you implement a function that takes a Vector and a fruit name as parameters and removes that specific fruit from
  the
  Vector?
- How would you modify the program to sort the fruits alphabetically?
- Can you extend the program to count the occurrences of each fruit in the Vector?
