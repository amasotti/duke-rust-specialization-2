# Counting Frequencies with HashMaps

Hashmaps are a powerful data structure that can be used to count the frequency of elements
in a list.

## Challenges

1. Can you modify the program to accept input from the user and then calculate the frequency of each integer?
2. Can you extend this concept to count the frequency of words in a sentence?
3. How would you modify the program to sort the final result by frequency?


## Note

For question three the answer is to use a TreeMap (or BTreeMap) 
or to convert to a vector and sort by frequency.
Is quite simple, I didn't do it to keep the code focused on the hashmap.
